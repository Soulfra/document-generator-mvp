# 🔨 Ralph's Sovereign Agent Execution Guide

**SOLUTION TO BASH LOOP PROBLEM** ✅  
**Using Ralph's Proven Node.js Infrastructure** 🎯

---

## 🎭 THE SOLUTION

Instead of fighting shell environment issues, we're now using **Ralph's proven testing infrastructure** combined with **Context Profiles** to test your Sovereign Agents system.

### 🔨 What Ralph Built For You:

1. **`ralph-sovereign-agent-test.js`** - Ralph's aggressive testing system for your agents
2. **`sovereign-agents-context-profile.json`** - Complete configuration for agent behavior  
3. **`run-ralph-sovereign-test.js`** - Orchestration script that manages everything

---

## 🚀 EXECUTE THIS SINGLE COMMAND

```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator
node run-ralph-sovereign-test.js
```

### 🎼 What This Will Do:

1. **Load Context Profile** - Ralph reads your agent configuration
2. **Check Docker Status** - Ralph verifies if services are running
3. **Start Services** - Ralph starts Docker services if needed
4. **Wait for Ready** - Ralph waits for all services to initialize
5. **Run Bash Tests** - Ralph executes comprehensive agent testing
6. **Generate Report** - Ralph provides final verdict

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Ralph's Test Fails:

**🐳 Docker Issues:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**🔧 Service Not Ready:**
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs sovereign-agents

# Restart specific service  
docker-compose restart sovereign-agents
```

**🌐 Port Conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using port 8085
lsof -i :8085

# Kill if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Manual Testing Commands:

If you want to test individually:
```bash
# Test health
curl http://localhost:8085/health

# List agents
curl http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/agents

# Process document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/process-document \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"documentContent":"# Test","documentType":"markdown"}'
```
