## 🔧 Integration with Existing Systems

This CAPTCHA system can be integrated with the existing Document Generator platform:

```javascript
// Add CAPTCHA protection to document upload
app.post('/api/upload', 
  captchaService.captchaMiddleware('custom', 'document_upload'),
  uploadHandler
);

// Add bot detection to API endpoints
app.use('/api/', captchaService.botDetectionMiddleware());
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

const captchaService = new CaptchaProtectionService(database);

// Environment configuration
const config = {
  // Use real database for challenge storage
  database: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // Configure rate limiting
  rateLimiting: { rpm: 60, burst: 10 },
  // Add monitoring integration  
  monitoring: process.env.MONITORING_URL
};
```
