echo "Complex System          →  Simple Mirror"
echo "─────────────────────────────────────────────"
echo "52 agents in database   →  8 agents in memory"

echo "=================="
echo "1. IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK: You see results instantly"
echo "2. NO BARRIERS: Nothing to install or configure"
echo "3. SAME CONCEPTS: Shows the same AI interaction patterns"
echo "4. ACTUAL WORKING: Not a mockup - real interactive system"
echo "5. FOUNDATION: Easy to expand once you see it works"

echo "🚀 NEXT STEPS (Optional):"
echo "========================="
echo "1. Play with the simple demo to understand the concept"
echo "2. Once you see it works, we can add complexity gradually"
echo "3. Add more agents, persistence, networking as needed"
echo "4. Scale up to the full 52-agent system when ready"

echo "==================="

echo "=================="
