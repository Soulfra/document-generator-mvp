# Future Roadmap: Agentic Orchestration OS

This document outlines the long-term vision for a fully agentic, extensible automation platform (like n8n/Make/Zapier) for FinishThisIdea.

---

## 1. Orchestration UI
- Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop)
- Node-based automation chaining
- Real-time monitoring and logs
- Manual and scheduled triggers

## 2. API & Extensibility
- REST API for triggering and managing automations
- Plugin system for custom nodes/scripts
- Webhook support for external integrations

## 3. No-Code/Low-Code Support
- YAML/JSON workflow configs for non-devs
- UI for mapping Figma designs to code components
- Form-based onboarding and proposal submission

## 4. Agentic Features
- Self-healing workflows (auto-retry, fallback)
- AI-powered suggestions for new automations
- Automated documentation and changelog updates
- Integration with LLMs for code review and script generation

## 5. Next Steps
- Prototype a workflow runner (Node.js or Python)
- Explore open-source workflow engines (n8n, Temporal, Prefect)
- Build a simple web dashboard for monitoring
- Gather feedback from devs and non-devs
