# Energy Card + Context Profile Integration

## Overview

We've successfully enhanced the `context-profiles.js` system to integrate with the energy card system from `context-energy-cards.js`. This creates a powerful context deduction mechanism based on energy card usage patterns.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Energy Requirements per Profile
Each environment profile now has specific energy card requirements:

- **Development**: Basic cards (cookie, localStorage, userProfile)
- **Staging**: Auth cards (cookie, jwt, userProfile, apiKey)  
- **Production**: Full stack (cookie, jwt, userProfile, apiKey, docker, redis)
- **Remote**: Distributed cards (cookie, jwt, websocket, remote, docker)

### 2. Energy-Based Profile Switching
Profile switching now validates and consumes energy:
```javascript
// Validates energy availability
const canSwitch = await validateEnergyForProfile(profileName);

// Consumes energy for activation
await useEnergyForProfileSwitch(profileName);

// Deduces context from energy state
await deduceContextFromEnergy();
```

### 3. Context Deduction from Energy
The system can deduce user context based on:
- Energy card inventory
- Card usage patterns
- Card levels and experience
- Energy regeneration rates

### 4. Dynamic Capability Enhancement
As energy cards level up, profile capabilities increase:
- API Key Level 5 → Enhanced analysis depth
- Docker Level 3 → Enhanced monitoring
- WebSocket Level 4 → Real-time features

### 5. Energy Usage Pattern Analysis
The system tracks:
- Authentication usage (cookies, JWT)
- Storage patterns (localStorage, database)
- Real-time activity (websockets)
- API consumption patterns

## New CLI Commands

```bash
# Show energy card status
node context-profiles.js energy

# Deduce context from energy cards
node context-profiles.js deduce

# Validate energy for a profile
node context-profiles.js validate production

# Create energy-aware deployment script
node context-profiles.js deploy-energy
```

## Usage Example

```javascript
const profileManager = new ContextProfileManager();

// Energy cards are automatically initialized
// Switching profiles now requires energy
await profileManager.switchProfile('production');

// Context is automatically deduced from cards
const context = await profileManager.deduceContextFromEnergy();
console.log(`User level: ${context.user.level}`);
console.log(`Device power: ${context.device.powerLevel}%`);
```

## Energy Flow

1. **Profile Activation**: Consumes energy based on profile requirements
2. **Context Deduction**: Uses combination of 4 cards (userProfile, history, location, device)
3. **Feature Activation**: Different combinations unlock different features
4. **Regeneration**: Cards regenerate energy over time
5. **Level System**: Cards gain XP and level up through usage

## Integration Points

- **Trading Card Interface**: Can display user's energy profile
- **Content Orchestrator**: Can use energy levels to determine processing capacity
- **Document Generator**: Can adjust generation quality based on available energy

## Next Steps

1. **Framework Energy Matrix**: Map technology stacks to energy requirements
2. **Energy Inventory Display**: Visual representation of card collection
3. **Card Combination UI**: Interface for executing energy combinations
4. **Energy Flow Visualization**: Real-time energy usage dashboard
5. **Remote Control Integration**: Connect energy cards to remote systems

This creates a complete resource management layer where computational and contextual capabilities are powered by collectible energy cards - just like Pokemon energy cards or OSRS runes!
