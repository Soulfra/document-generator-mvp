## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Current State of Haptic Technology

Current haptic feedback systems rely on simple pattern libraries or basic amplitude/frequency modulation to generate vibration patterns. These approaches have several limitations:

```

### Core Algorithms

#### 1. Data-to-Knot Conversion

**Text Encoding:**
```
For each character c in text:
  crossing[i] = {
    over: character_position(i),
    under: (i + 1) mod text.length,
    position: {x: cos(ascii(c) * 0.1), y: sin(ascii(c) * 0.1)},
    intensity: is_vowel(c) ? 0.8 : 0.4
  }
  
writhe += is_vowel(c) ? 1 : 0
```

**Numerical Data Encoding:**
```
binary_rep = number.to_binary()
For each bit b at position i:
  crossing[i] = {
    over: b ? i : (i+1) mod length,
    under: b ? (i+1) mod length : i,
    position: {x: i * 2, y: b ? 1 : -1}
  }
  writhe += b ? 1 : -1
```

#### 2. Topoisomerase Simplification

**ATP Cost Model:**
```
energy_cost = 2 * ATP_per_operation * (1 + toxicity * drug_factor)
complexity_reduction = initial_complexity * (1 - efficiency * passage_probability)
```

**Strand Passage Algorithm:**
```
identify_g_segment(knot):
  return crossing with maximum local_curvature(crossing, neighbors)

identify_t_segment(knot, g_segment):
  return crossing that maximizes complexity_reduction(g_segment, crossing)

apply_topoisomerase(knot, g_segment, t_segment):
  create_double_strand_break(g_segment)
  pass_strand_through_break(t_segment)
  religate_strands()
  update_crossing_count(knot, -2)
```

#### 3. Haptic Parameter Mapping

**Frequency Calculation:**
```
base_frequency = 60 Hz + (writhe * 5 Hz)
modulation_frequency = crossing_count * 2 Hz
```

**Amplitude Envelope:**
```
For normalized_time t in [0,1]:
  if complexity < 20:
    amplitude(t) = sin(t * π)
  else if complexity < 50:
    amplitude(t) = sin(t * π) * (1 + 0.3 * sin(t * 3π))
  else:
    amplitude(t) = sin(t * π) * (0.5 + 0.5 * t²) + 0.2 * sin(t * 5π)
```

**Duration Mapping:**
```
duration = min(max_duration, max(min_duration, crossing_count * 100ms))
```

#### 4. Safety Validation

**Intensity Limits:**
```
max_continuous_duration = 10000ms
max_intensity = 100%
intensity_ramp_rate = 0.1 per ms
cooldown_period = 2000ms between intense patterns
```

**Pattern Validation:**
```
validate_pattern(pattern):
  check duration ≤ max_continuous_duration
  check max(intensity) ≤ max_intensity
  check rapid_intensity_changes < 30% of pattern
  check average_intensity reasonable for duration
```

### Implementation Examples

2. Generate knot with 5 crossings, writhe = 2 (vowels: e,o)
3. Calculate base frequency: 60 + (2*5) = 70 Hz
4. Generate amplitude envelope with vowel emphasis
5. Output: 800ms vibration pattern with vowel peaks

#### Example 2: Heartbeat Encoding

**Input:** [800ms, 820ms, 790ms, 810ms] RR intervals
**Process:**
1. Convert intervals to crossings based on variability
2. Writhe reflects heart rate trend
3. Complexity maps to heart rate variability
4. Output: Pulsing pattern matching heart rhythm

**Input:** {type: "joy", intensity: 0.8}
**Process:**
1. Map joy to trefoil knot (3 crossings, writhe=2)
2. Scale by intensity (0.8)
3. Generate uplifting frequency progression

### Device Integration

#### Mobile Implementation
```javascript
class MobileHapticEncoder {
  encodeForMobile(pattern) {
    // Optimize for mobile vibration motor limitations
    simplified_pattern = this.optimizeForDevice(pattern, {
      max_intensity: 80%, // Mobile motors limited
      discrete_levels: 3, // On/off/medium only
      max_duration: 5000  // Battery conservation
    });
    
    return this.convertToWebVibrationAPI(simplified_pattern);
  }
}
```
