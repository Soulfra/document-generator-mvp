# 🎲 D&D-Style Web Design System

**Transform web development into an epic campaign where AI agents work like D&D characters to build real applications!**

## 🏰 The Vision

This system turns web design into a Dungeons & Dragons-style campaign where:

- **Dungeon Master (DM)** = Master orchestrator that reasons through design decisions
- **Agents** = Specialized characters (HTML Master, CSS Mage, JS Wizard, etc.)
- **Quests** = Development tasks and features to implement
- **Artifacts** = Generated code, components, and assets
- **Campaign** = Your web project from concept to deployment

The visualization shows **ACTUAL reasoning** from AI agents working together, not just pretty animations!

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional development tools, this system:

1. **Shows Real Reasoning**: The 3D visualization displays actual AI decision-making processes
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents handle different aspects (HTML, CSS, JS, UX, SEO, Data)
3. **D&D Metaphor**: Makes complex web architecture understandable through gaming concepts
4. **Live Code Generation**: Watch agents generate real code in real-time
5. **Visual Programming**: Layer Rider system for drawing code like Line Rider
6. **Progressive AI**: Agents level up and improve over time

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start All Routers
```bash
./START-ALL-ROUTERS.sh
```

This launches:
- 🏰 Dungeon Master (Port 7777) - Main orchestrator
- 🔌 MCP Connector (Port 6666) - Multi-system coordinator
- ⚔️ 6 Specialized Agent Routers (Ports 7001-7006)
- 📡 WebSocket connections for real-time reasoning

### 2. Open Dashboards
```bash
./open-dashboards.sh
```

Or manually visit:
- **Sitemaster Dashboard**: `file://SITEMASTER-DASHBOARD.html`
- **Dungeon Master**: `http://localhost:7777`
- **3D API World**: `file://3D-API-WORLD.html`
- **Layer Rider Pi**: `file://LAYER-RIDER-PI.html`

### 3. Watch the Magic
- Observe AI agents reasoning in real-time
- See code being generated automatically
- Watch the 3D visualization of system interactions
- Use Layer Rider to add your own code layers

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. Campaign Initialization
- Dungeon Master starts a "web development campaign"
- Agents are assigned specialties and initial levels
- Campaign objective is set (e.g., "Build Document Generator MVP")

### 2. Reasoning Loop
Every 3 seconds, the Dungeon Master:
1. **Thinks** about current requirements
2. **Analyzes** options (mobile-first vs desktop, React vs vanilla JS, etc.)
3. **Makes decisions** based on project context
4. **Assigns quests** to appropriate agents
5. **Broadcasts reasoning** to all visualization systems

### 3. Agent Work
When assigned a quest, agents:
1. **Receive task** from Dungeon Master
2. **Generate code artifacts** (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)
3. **Level up** based on successful completions
4. **Report back** with solutions and insights

### 4. Real-Time Visualization
- **3D API World**: Shows agents as colored spheres around central MCP router
- **Packets flow** between agents representing actual data/decisions
- **Agent glow effects** when actively working
- **Progress indicators** based on real campaign advancement

### 5. Code Layer Generation
- **Layer Rider**: Creates visual code layers with proper OSS licenses
- **Real-time updates** when agents generate code
- **License assignment** based on agent type and project needs
- **Export functionality** for deployment to Raspberry Pi

lsof -i :7777
lsof -i :6667

# Kill conflicting processes
./stop-routers.sh
```

**WebSocket Connection Issues**
- Ensure all routers are started with `./START-ALL-ROUTERS.sh`
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Verify firewalls aren't blocking local connections

**Agents Not Working**
- Check Dungeon Master dashboard for agent status
- Restart specific agents by stopping and re-running start script
- Monitor terminal output for error messages

**No Code Generation**
- Verify agents are receiving quests from Dungeon Master
- Check reasoning process is active
- Force code generation via dashboard buttons

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Start with verbose logging
DEBUG=true ./START-ALL-ROUTERS.sh

# Monitor all logs
tail -f *.log
```
