# Automated Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to set up automated deployment for FinishThisIdea using Railway, Vercel, or similar platforms.

---

## 1. Choose a Platform
- **Railway:** Great for full-stack apps, easy database integration
- **Vercel/Netlify:** Best for frontend/static hosting
- **Other:** AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

## 2. Setup Steps
- Connect your GitHub repo to the platform
- Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`)
- Set up build and start scripts (`npm run build`, `npm start`)
- Add a `Dockerfile` if needed for custom environments

## 3. CI/CD Basics
- Enable automatic deploys on push to `main` or `production` branch
- Use GitHub Actions or platform-native CI for tests/linting
- Example GitHub Action:
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install deps
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

## 4. Best Practices
- Use separate environments for dev, staging, and prod
- Protect main branch with required reviews and CI
- Monitor deployments and set up alerts for failures
