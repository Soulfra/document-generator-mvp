# WASM Error Investigation Report
## RuntimeError: Aborted() in Claude CLI

**Date:** 2025-09-17  
**Claude CLI Version:** 1.0.57  
**Node.js Version:** v18.20.8  

### Error Analysis

The WASM error occurs in Claude Code CLI's internal rendering engine:

```
RuntimeError: Aborted(). Build with -sASSERTIONS for more info.
    at LA.insertChild (file:///.../claude-code/cli.js:664:6321)
    at wasm://wasm/0005694a:wasm-function[29]:0x4ff
```

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **WASM Module Source**
- Error originates from `claude-code/cli.js` 
- Involves `insertChild` operations (likely DOM/tree manipulation)
- WASM functions suggest compiled native modules (probably tree-sitter or similar)

#### 2. **Likely Culprits**
Based on the stack trace and common CLI patterns:

- **Tree-sitter parser**: Used for syntax highlighting and code analysis
- **Terminal rendering**: WASM-based terminal emulation
- **Text processing**: Large text buffers causing memory overflow
- **UI rendering**: Complex interface elements

#### 3. **Triggering Conditions**
From our observations:
- Large chat logs (187MB HTML files were present)
- High memory usage (99% detected by recovery system)
- Complex project structures with many files
- Long-running sessions with accumulated state

### Technical Details

#### Memory Pressure Indicators
```bash
# System was at 99% memory usage when error occurred
• CPU: ~50-55% usage
• Memory: 99% usage
• Multiple recovery cycles triggered
• Large files: 8x 187MB chat.html files found
```

#### Error Pattern Recognition
The error consistently shows:
1. `RuntimeError: Aborted()` - WASM module emergency exit
2. `insertChild` operations - DOM/tree manipulation failure  
3. `wasm-function` calls - Compiled native code execution
4. Memory exhaustion conditions

### Prevention Strategies

#### 1. **Memory Management**
- Clear large temporary files regularly
- Implement file size limits
- Monitor memory usage proactively

#### 2. **Session Management**
- Save state frequently for recovery
- Break up large operations into chunks
- Implement automatic cleanup

#### 3. **Resource Limits**
- Detect oversized files before processing
- Set memory usage thresholds
- Implement graceful degradation

### Recovery Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **Immediate Recovery**
- `claude-resume.sh` - Quick cleanup and context preservation
- `claude-safe.sh` - Protected Claude CLI execution with auto-recovery
- `wasm-error-recovery.js` - Comprehensive WASM-specific handling

#### 2. **Automated Monitoring**
- System Reset Recovery integration
- Real-time memory monitoring
- Process health checks

#### 3. **State Preservation**
- Context file backup
- Working directory preservation
- Recovery point creation

### Usage Instructions

#### For WASM Error Recovery:
```bash
# Manual recovery after WASM error
./claude-resume.sh

# Protected Claude CLI execution
./claude-safe.sh

# Full recovery system status
node wasm-error-recovery.js --status
```

#### Prevention:
```bash
# Check for large files before starting
find . -name "*.html" -size +50M -ls

# Monitor memory usage
vm_stat | head -5

# Clean up proactively  
./claude-resume.sh  # (can be used for preventive cleanup too)
```

### Recommendations

#### 1. **For Users**
- Use recovery scripts when hitting WASM errors
- Monitor project file sizes
- Close resource-heavy applications before using Claude CLI
- Save work frequently

#### 2. **For Development**
- Implement file size warnings in CLI
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Create automatic cleanup on startup
- Improve error messages for WASM failures

#### 3. **For System Administrators**
- Set up automated cleanup of large log files
- Monitor system memory usage
- Implement resource limits for CLI processes

### Future Improvements

1. **Claude CLI Enhancement Requests**
   - Better memory management in WASM modules
   - Graceful degradation on memory pressure
   - Built-in recovery mechanisms
   - Progress indicators for large operations

2. **Local Tooling**
   - Integration with IDE/editor for state preservation
   - Automated project cleanup
   - Resource usage dashboard
   - Predictive error detection

### Technical Appendix

#### Error Signatures Detected
```javascript
const wasmErrorPatterns = [
    /RuntimeError: Aborted\(\)/,
    /wasm:\/\/wasm\/\w+:wasm-function/,
    /insertChild.*wasm/,
    /Build with -sASSERTIONS for more info/,
    /LA\.insertChild/,
    /Aborted\(\)\. Build with -sASSERTIONS/
];
```

#### Recovery Actions Available
- `clear_claude_cache` - Clear CLI caches
- `clear_large_files` - Remove oversized temporary files
- `force_gc` - Trigger garbage collection
- `preserve_context` - Backup working state
- `create_resume_point` - Enable session resumption
