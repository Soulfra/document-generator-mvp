# Monitoring

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about monitoring in the FinishThisIdea platform. It covers all aspects from basic concepts to advanced implementation details.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing monitoring, ensure you have:

- **System Requirements**:
  - Node.js 18.0 or higher
  - npm 9.0 or higher
  - Docker 20.0+ (for containerized deployments)
  - 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
  - 20GB available disk space

- **Access Requirements**:
  - Administrative access to the deployment environment
  - API keys for required services (see Configuration section)
  - Network access to external services
  - Proper security clearances for production access

- **Knowledge Requirements**:
  - Understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Familiarity with REST APIs
  - Basic Docker knowledge
  - Understanding of the FinishThisIdea architecture

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up monitoring:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/finishthisidea.git
   cd finishthisidea
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   nano .env
   ```

4. **Initialize the Service**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:monitoring
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   npm run test:monitoring
   ```

## Configuration

Configure monitoring using environment variables or configuration files:

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core Settings
NODE_ENV=production
SERVICE_NAME=monitoring
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/finishthisidea
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_CACHE=true
ENABLE_MONITORING=true
DEBUG_MODE=false
```

### Configuration File

```javascript
// config/monitoring.js
module.exports = {
  service: {
    name: 'monitoring',
    version: '1.0.0',
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  },
  server: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
    timeout: 30000,
    corsOrigins: ['http://localhost:3001']
  },
  features: {
    rateLimit: {
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
      max: 100
    },
    cache: {
      ttl: 3600,
      checkPeriod: 600
    }
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices when working with monitoring:

1. **Error Handling**
   - Always wrap async operations in try-catch
   - Log errors with context for debugging
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Return meaningful error messages to users

2. **Performance**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement request batching where possible
   - Monitor and optimize slow queries

3. **Security**
   - Never log sensitive data
   - Validate all input data
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Keep dependencies updated

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up comprehensive logging
   - Track key performance metrics
   - Create alerts for anomalies
   - Maintain audit trails

5. **Development**
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Document all APIs
   - Use consistent coding style
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines
