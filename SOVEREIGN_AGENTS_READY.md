# 🎭 Sovereign Agents System - READY FOR EXECUTION

**Status**: ✅ SYSTEM BUILT AND READY  
**Testing**: 🔨 Ralph's Infrastructure Created  
**Documentation**: 📚 Complete Guides Available  

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE EXECUTION STEPS

Since shell execution is limited, here are the **exact commands to run manually**:

### Step 1: Navigate and Execute Ralph
```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator
node execute-ralph-now.js
```

### Step 2: If Services Need Starting
```bash
docker-compose up -d
sleep 60
node execute-ralph-now.js
```

### Step 3: Manual Validation
```bash
# Test health
curl http://localhost:8085/health

# List agents
curl -s http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/agents | jq

# Process document
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/process-document \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"documentContent":"# Test SaaS\\nBuild a simple app","documentType":"markdown"}'
```
