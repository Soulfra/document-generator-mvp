- Editable schemas
- Connects to all tiers

### Option 2: Run Connection Tests
```bash
node connect-everything.js --start
```
- Auto-detects available components
- Starts the best available option
- Shows connection status

### Option 3: Test All Connections
```bash
node test-all-connections.js
```
- Tests all files exist
- Verifies module loading
- Shows detailed results

### Option 4: View Tier Map
```bash
node tier-connector.js
```
- Discovers all 13+ tiers
- Shows connections between tiers
- Recommends execution command

## 🧪 Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Character System
```bash
node character-system-max.js
```
Expected: Characters introduce themselves with their catchphrases

### Step 2: Test Web Interface
```bash
node execute-character-system.js
```
Expected: Web server starts on port 8888

### Step 3: Test API Server
```bash
node services/api-server/index.js
```
Expected: API server starts on port 3001

### Step 4: Test Sovereign Agents
```bash
node services/sovereign-agents/src/index.js
```
Expected: Sovereign agent system initializes

### Step 5: Test Complete System
```bash
node final-executor.js
```
Expected: All layers execute in sequence

## 💾 Memory Optimization

If running out of memory:

### Use Minimal Launcher
```bash
# Run quick deploy script
./quick-deploy.sh

# Then use minimal launcher
node launch.js
```

### Use Symlink Memory Saver
```bash
node symlink-memory-saver.js
```

### Start Only Character System
```bash
node character-system-max.js
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If nothing starts:
1. Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Check files exist: `ls -la *.js`
3. Run connection test: `node connect-everything.js`

### If web interface won't load:
1. Check port 8888 is free: `lsof -i :8888`
2. Try different port in execute-character-system.js
3. Start character system only: `node character-system-max.js`

### If out of memory:
1. Close all terminals except one
2. Run: `./quick-deploy.sh`
3. Use minimal mode: `node launch.js`

## 📝 What Each File Does

- `character-system-max.js` - Core character system with 7 living characters
- `execute-character-system.js` - Web interface wrapper for characters
- `tier-connector.js` - Discovers and connects all 13+ tiers
- `connect-everything.js` - Auto-connection script
- `test-all-connections.js` - Comprehensive connection tester
- `final-executor.js` - Executes all layers in sequence
- `master-orchestrator.js` - Orchestrates with character system
- `quick-deploy.sh` - Memory-saving deployment script
- `symlink-memory-saver.js` - Creates symlinks to save memory

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:
1. Characters introduce themselves in the console
2. Web interface loads at http://localhost:8888
3. You can chat with characters
4. Characters respond with personality
5. Everything is editable through the web UI

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Start with: `node execute-character-system.js`
2. Open: http://localhost:8888
3. Chat with Nova to understand the system
4. Ask Flux to make things editable
5. Have Zen simplify the 13+ tiers
6. Let Aria orchestrate document processing

The system is ready - no more planning, just execution!
