## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Start Simple**: MVP first, enhance later
2. **Use Ollama**: Free local LLM for most tasks
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Only use expensive LLMs when needed
4. **Test Everything**: 80%+ coverage required
5. **Document as You Go**: Keep docs in sync with code

## Getting Started

Pick your starting week based on your goals:
- **Just want to launch?** Start with Week 1
- **Have users waiting?** Jump to Week 2 for the full experience
- **Ready to scale?** Week 3 shows you how
- **Enterprise clients?** Week 4 has what you need

Each guide is self-contained but builds on previous weeks.
