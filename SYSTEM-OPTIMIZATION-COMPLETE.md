node context-switching-engine.js        # Port 3013  
node enhanced-http-server.js            # Port 3014
node docker-optimization-system.js      # One-time optimization
```

### Docker Optimization (One-time setup)
```bash
# Run Docker optimization
node docker-optimization-system.js

# Or use the generated script
./optimize-docker-network.sh
```

## 📊 Access Points

After deployment, you'll have these interfaces:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **System Coordinator** | http://localhost:3000 | Master dashboard for everything |
| **Performance Monitor** | http://localhost:3010 | 20x slowdown detection and metrics |
| **Context Switching** | http://localhost:3013 | Screenshot capture and state management |
| **Enhanced HTTP Server** | http://localhost:3014 | WASM/HJS file testing and serving |
| **Template Processor** | http://localhost:3000 | Your existing MCP template processor |
| **AI API Service** | http://localhost:3001 | Your existing AI services |

## 🔍 Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test 20x Slowdown Fix
- Open http://localhost:3010
- Look for "Max Slowdown" metrics
- Should show values near 1.0x instead of 20x
- Watch for "20x SLOWDOWN DETECTED" alerts (should not appear)

### 2. Test Context Switching
- Open http://localhost:3013
- Switch between different applications/windows
- Should see screenshots captured automatically
- Check the context history grid for visual thumbnails

### 3. Test WASM/HJS File Serving
- Open http://localhost:3014
- Click "Test WASM Loading" and "Test HJS Files" buttons
- Should show proper MIME types and security headers
- Try accessing .wasm/.hjs/.data files directly

### 4. Test System Coordination
- Open http://localhost:3000 (master dashboard)
- Should see all systems as "RUNNING"
- Try restarting a system to test recovery
- Check alerts section for any issues

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- ❌ 20x slower than expected timing
- ❌ No visual feedback on context switching

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If 20x Slowdown Persists:
1. Check Performance Monitor dashboard for specific bottlenecks
2. Look at Docker container resource usage
3. Review system logs in `logs/` directory
4. Use System Coordinator to restart problematic services

### If Context Switching Doesn't Work:
1. Check permissions for screenshot capture
2. Verify window tracking is working in the dashboard
3. Look for error messages in the Context Switching Engine logs

### If WASM/HJS Files Don't Load:
1. Test the Enhanced HTTP Server directly
2. Check browser console for CORS or security errors
3. Verify proper MIME types in the test interface

### If Services Won't Start:
1. Check port conflicts: `lsof -i :3000-3015`
2. Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
3. Check system logs for specific error messages
4. Use the System Coordinator restart functions

## 🎯 Summary

- **✅ 20x Slowdown**: Real-time detection and alerts with performance monitoring
- **✅ Context Switching**: Screenshot capture and state preservation when switching screens
- **✅ File Serving**: Proper `.html`, `.hjs`, `.data`, and `.wasm` file handling with security
- **✅ System Coordination**: Unified management to fix the "fucked" system state

The systems work together to provide a comprehensive solution that should resolve your timing issues, context switching needs, and HTTP serving problems while providing centralized monitoring and management.

**Next Step**: Run `./launch-optimized-system.sh` and monitor the dashboards to verify the 20x slowdown is resolved!
