# Custom output location
node record-diamond-trailer.js --output ./my-trailers
```

## 🎥 Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **HTML5 Canvas** - Renders 3D visualizations and animations
2. **Puppeteer** - Captures frames programmatically
3. **FFmpeg** - Compiles frames into video formats
4. **Automated Timing** - 50-second scripted sequence

### Scene Breakdown
- Title Scene: 5 seconds
- Universe Visualization: 8 seconds
- Diamond Core: 6 seconds
- COBOL Reality: 8 seconds
- Time Dilation: 6 seconds
- Reality Transfer: 7 seconds
- Grand Finale: 10 seconds

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Node.js** - For running the recording script
- **FFmpeg** - For video encoding
- **Puppeteer** - Auto-installed by the script
- **Chrome/Chromium** - For rendering

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For Your README
```markdown
![Diamond Layer Demo](./trailer-output/diamond-layer-trailer.gif)
```

### For Investors
- Upload MP4 to Vimeo/YouTube
- Embed in pitch decks
- Show at presentations

### For Social Media
- Share GIF on Twitter/LinkedIn
- Post WebM on technical forums
- Create teaser clips

### For Documentation
- Embed in your docs site
- Use as onboarding material
- Technical deep-dive videos

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Add Sound Effects
```javascript
// Start sound service
node MOVIE-STYLE-SOUND-EFFECTS.js

// Record with audio
// Then merge with ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4
```

### Create Multiple Versions
```bash
# Technical audience - focus on architecture
./create-trailer.sh --scenes technical

# Business audience - focus on value
./create-trailer.sh --scenes business

# Quick social media teaser
./create-trailer.sh --duration 15 --format gif
```

### Batch Processing
Generate multiple trailers for different audiences:
```bash
for quality in low medium high; do
  node record-diamond-trailer.js --quality $quality --output trailers/$quality
done
```

## 📊 Performance Tips

1. **Close other applications** - Recording needs resources
2. **Use SSD storage** - Faster frame writes
3. **Adjust frame rate** - 15fps for smaller files, 60fps for smooth motion
4. **Preview first** - Use browser preview before recording

## 🎬 Example Output Stats

- **GIF** (15fps, 960px): ~10MB for 50 seconds
- **MP4** (30fps, 1080p): ~20MB high quality
- **WebM** (30fps, 1080p): ~15MB web optimized

## 🌟 Showcase Your Creation

Once you have your trailer:

1. **Add to your repository**
   ```bash
   git add trailer-output/diamond-layer-trailer.gif
   git commit -m "Add cinematic trailer demonstrating Diamond Layer architecture"
   ```

2. **Share on social media**
   - Tag #DiamondLayer #ArchaeologicalComputing
   - Link to your repo

3. **Submit to conferences**
   - Use as supplementary material
   - Demo video for talks

## 🚀 What This Demonstrates

Your trailer visually proves:
- ✅ COBOL integration as a parallel reality
- ✅ Time dilation handling batch processing
- ✅ Entities traveling between realities
- ✅ 459-layer universe architecture
- ✅ Diamond Layer crystalline verification
- ✅ "Everything is one game" philosophy

## 💎 The Message

This trailer transforms complex technical concepts into a visual story that anyone can understand. It shows that the Diamond Layer isn't just architecture - it's a new way of thinking about software where:

- Legacy systems aren't replaced, they're preserved as archaeological realities
- Time differences are features, not bugs
- Every service is just another NPC in the game
- The multiverse isn't science fiction - it's your system architecture
