# Why MCP Isn't Working With Agents (And How We Fixed It)

## The Core Issue

You were right to be frustrated. Here's what happened:

1. **MCP is a Protocol** - It's designed for AI assistants (like Claude Code) to communicate with tools
2. **Agents are Bash Scripts** - They can't speak the MCP protocol
3. **These were never connected** - Two separate systems built in isolation

## How MCP Actually Works

```
Claude Code → MCP Protocol → MCP Server → Tools
     ↑             ↑              ↑          ↑
     |             |              |          |
 You type    stdio pipes    Node.js app   Functions
```

MCP **only** runs when Claude Code connects to it. It's not a standalone server you can curl or call from bash.

## What We Built to Fix It

### 1. Standalone Content Generator
`scripts/generate-real-content.js` - Extracts the content generation logic so bash scripts can use it directly.

### 2. Updated Agent System
`scripts/agent-work-real.sh` now uses the standalone generator to create REAL content, not stubs.

### 3. MCP Configuration
`~/.config/claude/mcp.json` - Now properly configured so Claude Code can use MCP tools.

## The Working System

```
For Agents:
agent-coordinator.sh → agent-work-real.sh → generate-real-content.js → Real Content

For Claude:
You type in Claude → MCP Protocol → MCP Server → create-doc-with-agent.js → Real Content
```

## Current Status

✅ **Agents generate real content** - Using standalone generator
✅ **MCP is configured** - Claude Code can now use MCP tools
✅ **No more stubs** - Both paths produce real documentation
✅ **Tests enforce quality** - Can't commit TODOs or placeholders

## How to Use It

### For Documentation (via Agents)
```bash
# Single doc
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh start docs
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh assign "docs/category/file.md"

# Batch docs
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh batch-docs 5
```

### For Documentation (via MCP in Claude)
Just ask Claude to create documentation - MCP tools are now available.

### To Test Content Generation
```bash
# Direct test
node scripts/generate-real-content.js operations monitoring test.md

# Full system test  
./test-real-system.sh
```

## Why This Was So Confusing

1. MCP documentation made it seem like a regular server
2. The integration was half-built (tools existed but no way to run them)
3. Multiple disconnected attempts to fix it created more confusion
4. Error messages weren't clear about what was actually broken

## The Bottom Line

- **MCP works now** - But only inside Claude Code
- **Agents work now** - Using the standalone generator
- **Both create real content** - No more stubs or TODOs
- **The system is finally integrated** - Everything connects properly
