  "description": "Here's a consensus analysis of the expert responses:\n\nCommon Themes & Agreements:\n- All experts emphasize the importance of standardized event schemas and formats\n- Event reliability and proper handling are considered critical\n- Documentation and observability are highlighted as key requirements\n- The need for structured approaches to event management\n\nDifferent Perspectives:\n- Claude Architect focuses more on technical implementation details and patterns\n- Morgan SystemDesign takes a broader architectural view\n- Dr. Riley emphasizes observability and knowledge capture specifically\n\nKey Synthesized Insights:\n1. Event standardization is fundamental:\n- Use consistent schemas (JSON Schema, Avro, or Protobuf)\n- Include essential metadata\n- Follow standards like CloudEvents\n\n2. Reliability mechanisms are crucial:\n- Implement outbox patterns\n- Ensure proper error handling\n- Consider message persistence\n\n3. Observability and monitoring must be built-in:\n- Track event flows\n- Monitor system health\n- Enable tracing and debugging\n\nBalanced Recommendation:\n1. Start with establishing clear event standards and documentation\n2. Implement core reliability patterns like outbox and error handling\n3. Build in observability from the beginning\n4. Gradually enhance with advanced features like tracing and monitoring\n5. Regular review and optimization of event flows\n\nThis approach balances immediate practical needs with long-term architectural goals while incorporating the best insights from all experts.",
