# Figma Basics Guide

Welcome to Figma! This guide will help you get started with the basics of using Figma for design and collaboration.

---

## 1. What is Figma?
- Figma is a cloud-based design tool for UI/UX, prototyping, and collaboration.
- It works in your browserâ€”no installation required.
- Multiple people can work on the same file in real time.

## 2. Navigating Figma
- **Files:** Each project has one or more files (pages, frames, components).
- **Layers:** Like Photoshop/Sketch, but for UI elements.
- **Pages:** Use for different flows, screens, or versions.

## 3. Commenting & Feedback
- Click the **Comment** button (top bar) to leave feedback anywhere on the design.
- Tag teammates with `@name` for notifications.
- Resolve comments when addressed.

## 4. Inspecting & Exporting Assets
- Select any element and click **Inspect** (right sidebar) to see CSS, colors, and spacing.
- Download images, SVGs, or icons by selecting and clicking **Export**.
- Developers can copy CSS, iOS, or Android code snippets directly.

## 5. Collaboration Tips
- Use Figma's built-in chat and comments for quick questions.
- Use version history to revert or review changes.
- Designers and devs should sync regularly to avoid drift.
