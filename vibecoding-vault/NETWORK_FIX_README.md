# Network Connectivity Fix for Vibecoding Vault

This fix addresses the network connectivity issues preventing the Electron app from accessing WiFi and the internet.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. **Certificate Issues**
- Disabled certificate errors in development mode
- Added proper certificate handling for HTTPS connections
- Configured certificate verification for localhost development

### 2. **DNS Resolution**
- Forced IPv4 DNS resolution
- Added DNS-over-HTTPS support using Google DNS
- Option to disable IPv6 if causing issues
- Custom DNS server configuration

### 3. **Proxy Configuration**
- Auto-detection of system proxy settings
- Proper proxy bypass for localhost
- Disabled problematic proxy auto-detection

### 4. **Network Protocols**
- Enabled all Chrome network features
- Added QUIC protocol support
- Fixed WebSocket connections
- Proper timeout configurations

### 5. **Content Security Policy**
- Configured CSP to allow necessary network connections
- Enabled WebSocket connections (ws:// and wss://)
- Proper CORS handling

## üìã Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Launch Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator/vibecoding-vault
./launch-electron.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run network test
node test-network-connectivity.js

# Start Electron app
npm start:dev
```

## üîç Testing Network Connectivity

The app now includes a comprehensive network testing page that will:
- Test basic internet connectivity
- Check HTTPS/SSL certificate handling
- Verify DNS resolution
- Display system network information
- Show real-time telemetry data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you still can't connect:

1. **Check Firewall/Antivirus**
   - Ensure Electron is allowed through your firewall
   - Add exception for node.exe and electron.exe

2. **Corporate Proxy**
   ```bash
   # Set proxy environment variables
   export HTTP_PROXY="http://your-proxy:8080"
   export HTTPS_PROXY="http://your-proxy:8080"
   export NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1"
   ```

3. **Disable IPv6** (if causing issues)
   ```bash
   export DISABLE_IPV6=1
   ```

4. **Use Custom DNS**
   ```bash
   export CUSTOM_DNS="8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1"
   ```

5. **Reset Network Settings**
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
   sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   
   # On Windows (run as Administrator)
   ipconfig /release
   ipconfig /renew
   ipconfig /flushdns
   netsh winsock reset
   ```

## üìä Monitoring

The app now includes comprehensive telemetry that tracks:
- Network errors and their causes
- Response times for all requests
- Failed connection attempts
- Certificate errors

Access telemetry data:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Run: `telemetry.getSummary()`
- Check the network test page for visual stats

## üîó Files Created

1. **electron-main.js** - Main Electron process with network fixes
2. **electron-network-fix.js** - Comprehensive network fix module
3. **preload.js** - Secure bridge for renderer process
4. **network-test.html** - Network connectivity testing page
5. **test-network-connectivity.js** - Command-line network test
6. **launch-electron.sh** - Easy launch script with proper environment

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Run the launch script to test connectivity
2. Check the network test page for any remaining issues
3. Use the telemetry service to monitor errors
4. Report any persistent issues with network logs

## üí° Tips

- Always run in development mode first to see detailed logs
- Check the console for certificate warnings
- Use the network test page to diagnose specific issues
- The telemetry service will capture all network errors automatically

The network connectivity issues should now be resolved. The app will:
‚úÖ Connect to WiFi networks properly
‚úÖ Access external websites (like Google)
‚úÖ Handle HTTPS certificates correctly
‚úÖ Work behind corporate proxies
‚úÖ Provide detailed error tracking
