# Figma Handoff & Design System Integration

This guide explains how to integrate Figma designs and design system updates into the FinishThisIdea MVP.

---

## 1. Accessing Figma Files
- Figma project link: [Insert Figma Link Here]
- Request access from the design lead if needed

## 2. Reviewing Design Updates
- Check for new or updated components, layouts, or flows
- Use Figma's inspect mode for CSS, spacing, and assets
- Communicate with designers about any ambiguities

## 3. Implementing Design Changes
- Sync with the latest Figma version before starting
- Use the design system for colors, typography, and spacing
- Reuse existing React components where possible
- Create new components only if not in the design system
- Test for responsiveness and accessibility

## 4. Collaboration Best Practices
- Use Figma comments for feedback and questions
- Schedule regular design/dev syncs for major updates
- Document any design decisions in `/docs` or `/cursor/mvp-improvements-module/`

## 5. Keeping Everything in Sync
- Update the design system as new patterns emerge
- Ensure all implemented changes are reflected in Figma
- Review UI/UX with the team before launch
