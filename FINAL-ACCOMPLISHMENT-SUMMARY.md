## 🎯 Solving Your Specific Requests

### **"6 systems → 4 tiers → 1 unified choice"** ✅ ACCOMPLISHED

**6 Disconnected Systems (Before):**
1. solidity (smart contracts)
2. flask (web framework) 
3. vessel (containers)
4. wizard (automation)

### **"jQuery-style navigation to help us query faster"** ✅ ACCOMPLISHED

```javascript
// Before: Confusing disconnected paths
❌ Can't find __tests__ directory

✅ const { tierManager } = require('../tier-manager.js');
✅ const { TIERS } = require('../../../__tests__/tier-manager.js');
✅ const ArtifactSystem = require('../progression/ArtifactCollectionSystem.js');
```

**Navigation Examples:**
- From gaming tests: `../tier-manager.js`

- ✅ **Real vs fake detection**: Blockchain-style action hashing
- ✅ **WebSocket real-time**: Live updates and interactions
- ✅ **World mirroring**: Green ↔ Crystal with prismatic effects
- ✅ **HyperCam interface**: Retro gaming style

### **"Replace 'this' with 'global' for databasing"** ✅ ACCOMPLISHED

```javascript

❌ this.playerData
❌ this.worldState
❌ this.securityState

// After: Unified global state
✅ global.mmorpgState.players
✅ global.mmorpgState.worlds
✅ global.mmorpgState.security
