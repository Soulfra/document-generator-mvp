# Local Gaming Freedom License (LGFL) v1.0

## üéÆ Simple Terms That Actually Make Sense

This license is for software that respects users and enables real gaming, not surveillance capitalism.

## ‚úÖ YOU CAN:

1. **Run it locally forever** - No internet required, no phone-home bullshit
2. **Modify anything** - Change it, break it, make it better
3. **Share with anyone** - Give it to friends, host it, distribute it
4. **Use commercially** - Make money with it, sell services, whatever
5. **Keep it private** - No obligation to share your changes

## ‚ùå YOU CANNOT:

1. **Add tracking/analytics** - No Google Analytics, no telemetry, no spyware
2. **Require internet** - Must work offline, no forced online features
3. **Add advertisements** - No ads, no sponsored content, no monetization through attention
4. **Lock features behind accounts** - No forced logins, no user registration
5. **Make it phone home** - No license checks, no DRM, no kill switches

## ü§ù THE DEAL:

If you distribute this software or modified versions:
- You must include this license
- You must keep it tracking-free
- You must keep it ad-free
- You must keep it locally runnable

## üß† THE PHILOSOPHY:

The internet turned into a surveillance machine disguised as services. Gaming became a trojan horse for data collection. This license ensures software remains a tool for users, not a tool against users.

- **Your computer, your rules**
- **Your data stays yours**
- **AI should work FOR you, not profile you**
- **Games should be fun, not manipulative**

## üìù ATTRIBUTION:

When sharing, include:
```
Licensed under the Local Gaming Freedom License (LGFL) v1.0
This software runs locally and respects your privacy
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL BITS:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This license is designed to be incompatible with surveillance capitalism. If you're trying to figure out how to add tracking while complying with this license, you're missing the point.

## üöÄ FOR DEVELOPERS:

Good code to add:
- Local multiplayer
- Offline AI models
- Peer-to-peer features

- Moddability

Bad code to add:
- Analytics

## üéØ EXAMPLES:

‚úÖ **GOOD**: "I modified this to add new building types and shared it with my gaming group"
