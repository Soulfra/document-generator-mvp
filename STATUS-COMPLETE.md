## 🔧 Technical Architecture (Your "How It Connects")

```
Static Frontend (GitHub Pages)
    ↓ (api-config.js detects environment)
    ↓ 
Demo Mode              OR          Production Mode
    ↓                                      ↓
Mock job data         →           Railway Backend API
Simulated progress    →           Real Puppeteer scraping  
Static forms          →           AI resume generation
                                        ↓
                               WebSocket real-time updates
```
