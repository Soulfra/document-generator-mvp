## 🔧 Freelancer Sourcing Strategy

### Where to Find Them
1. **Database/Backend**: Toptal, Gun.io
2. **Game Developers**: Unity Connect, GameDev.net
3. **Extension Developers**: Chrome Dev Forums, GitHub
4. **DevOps**: Platform.sh experts, Docker forums

### Interview Questions
1. "Show me something similar you've built"
2. "How would you handle [specific challenge]?"
3. "What's your approach to testing?"
4. "How do you ensure handoff success?"

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Can't show working examples
- Avoids talking about testing
- Promises everything immediately
- No questions about requirements

---

## 📊 Project Management

### Daily Standups (via Slack)
- What was completed yesterday?
- What's being worked on today?
- Any blockers?

### Weekly Demos
- Working functionality shown
- Not mockups or promises
- Deployed to staging environment

### Payment Structure
- 25% upfront
- 25% at working prototype
- 25% at integration
- 25% after handoff

---

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Integration Hell**: Avoided by testing early
2. **Scope Creep**: Locked requirements per phase
3. **Communication Issues**: Daily updates required
4. **Technical Debt**: Code review at each milestone

### Backup Plans
- Each component has fallback option
- Critical path items have 2 developers
- Weekly code backups
- Documentation throughout, not after

## 🎮 The Snowball Effect

### Week 1-2: Slow Start
- Just getting foundation right

- **This is normal and necessary**

### Week 3-6: Building Momentum
- Pieces start connecting
- First "aha!" moments
- Velocity increases

### Week 7-10: Rolling Fast
- Features landing daily
- Integration gets easier
- Team hits stride

### Week 11-12: Avalanche

## 📝 Final Notes

This plan is designed to:
1. **Start small and stable** - No rushing the foundation
2. **Build incrementally** - Each piece enables the next
3. **Test constantly** - Nothing moves forward broken
4. **Document everything** - No tribal knowledge
5. **Maintain pacing** - Not too fast, not too slow

The key is patience in the early phases. Like you said, "better to be patient and calm" until the real rewards come. This structure ensures that by the time we reach the game mechanics and browser extension phases, we have a rock-solid foundation that can support the advanced features.

**Remember**: This isn't about building fast, it's about building right. The snowball starts small but becomes unstoppable.
