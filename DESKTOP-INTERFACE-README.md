## 🆘 If Something Doesn't Work

### Common Issues:

**"Nothing happens when I click START"**
- Check the console (F12 in browser) for error messages
- Try the System Health check first

**"Can't drag and drop files"**
- Make sure you're dropping on the interface, not outside it
- Try using the "Drop Document" button instead

**"Services won't start"**
- Check if Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Try: `docker-compose up -d` from terminal

**"Interface looks broken"**
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
- Check if you have a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Quick Fixes:
```bash
# Reset everything and try again
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
./start-desktop.sh
```
