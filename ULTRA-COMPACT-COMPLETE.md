- **Automated scoring system** based on quality and speed

### 3. **One-Command Interface** (`doc-gen`)
**Ultra-simple commands:**
```bash
./doc-gen ultra      # Start everything (ultra-compact mode)
./doc-gen reasoning  # Start reasoning differential only
./doc-gen compare    # Run API comparison tests
./doc-gen start      # Regular mode
./doc-gen stop       # Stop everything
./doc-gen clean      # Clean system
```

### 4. **Intelligent System Management**
