- "Establishing trust creates a cryptographic bond that enables secure communication"
- "This verification provides high security while maintaining complete anonymity"
- "Bot swarm detected perfect verification pattern indicating excellent network health"

## 🎯 How Everything Connects

### 1. **Trust Events Trigger Visual Changes**
```
Handshake → Trust Node Spawns → Bots Deploy → Reasoning Explains
```

### 2. **AI Reasoning is Visual**
Instead of just logs, you see:
- Thought bubbles explaining WHY each action happened
- Visual connections showing WHAT it enables
- Bot behavior showing HOW verification works

### 3. **Real-time Verification**
Every trust action creates:
- Visual proof in the game world
- AI explanation of its purpose
- Bot swarm activity to verify it
- Network connections showing the bigger picture

## 🎮 Game Controls

### Camera Movement
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move camera around
- **Mouse Drag**: Pan the view
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out

### Interactions
- **Spacebar**: Trigger new handshake (creates new trust node)
- **Control Panel**: Right side buttons for various actions

### Control Panel Functions
- **🔄 Reset View**: Center camera on origin
- **🤖 Spawn Bot**: Manually create verification bot
- **🤝 New Handshake**: Trigger trust establishment
- **🗺️ Full Map**: Zoom out to see entire network
- **📸 Snapshot**: Export PNG of current view

## 🧠 AI Reasoning Integration

### What the AI Tells You
The reasoning panel shows explanations like:

```
🧠 AI Reasoning Stream
════════════════════

Trust Level 0.95 established between entities
→ Enables secure message exchange
→ Provides cryptographic proof of interaction  
→ Creates verifiable audit trail

Bot swarm deployed with 4 verification agents
→ ZKP verifier confirms mathematical proof
→ NLP analyzer validates trust language
→ System integrity maintained at 100%

Network now has 12 trust connections
→ Strengthens overall security posture
→ Enables collaborative AI operations
→ Trust density optimal for secure communications
```

### Why This Matters
Instead of wondering "what is my AI system doing?", you can:
- **SEE** every verification happening as bot movement
- **READ** AI explanations of why each action is beneficial  
- **UNDERSTAND** how trust relationships strengthen your security
- **WATCH** your network grow and become more secure

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Anonymous AI Handshake Trust System** (Port 6666)
- Handles actual cryptographic trust establishment
- Stores handshake data in SQLite database
- Provides HTTP API for trust operations

#### 2. **Unified Mapping Engine** (Port 7777)
- Maps trust data to game world coordinates
- Spawns and manages verification bot swarms
- Generates AI reasoning about trust events
- Provides WebSocket real-time updates

#### 3. **Game Visualization** (Port 8080)

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Trust Node Properties
```javascript
{
  id: "session-id-hex",
  position: { x: 250, y: 100, z: 50 },
  visual: {
    color: "#00ff88",     // Trust level determines color
    size: 35,             // Size based on verification layers
    glow: true,           // Glows when recently created
    shape: "hexagon"      // Shape shows completion status
  },
  data: {
    trustLevel: 0.95,     // Cryptographic trust score
    timestamp: 1640995200, // When established
    layers: ["zkp", "nlp", "qr", "temporal"] // Verification types
  }
}
```

### Bot Behavior Patterns
- **Patrol**: Orbit around trust nodes scanning for threats
- **Analyze**: Move between nodes gathering intelligence  
- **Verify**: Execute cryptographic verification tasks
- **Connect**: Establish and maintain network connections

### AI Reasoning Templates
The system uses templates to explain actions:
```javascript
"Establishing trust creates ${capability} enabling ${benefits}"
"Bot ${id} is ${action} to ensure ${security_purpose}"
"Network health is ${status} because ${reasons}"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Game Won't Connect
```bash
# Check if all services are running
lsof -i :6666  # Trust system
lsof -i :7777  # Mapping engine  
lsof -i :8080  # HTTP server
```

#### No Bots Appearing
- Trust system needs to be running first
- Try triggering a handshake with Spacebar
- Check reasoning panel for error messages

#### Reasoning Panel Empty
- WebSocket connection may be down
- Refresh page and check connection status
- Ensure mapping engine is running on port 7777

## 🎮 Advanced Usage

### Custom Bot Spawning
```javascript
// Send WebSocket message to spawn custom bot
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'spawn_verification',
  data: { 
    type: 'custom_verifier',
    task: 'Special verification task'
  }
}));
```

### Query Swarm Status
```javascript
// Get detailed bot information
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'query_swarm'
}));
```

### Request Entity Reasoning
```javascript
// Get AI reasoning for specific entity
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'request_reasoning',
  entityId: 'trust-node-id'
}));
```
