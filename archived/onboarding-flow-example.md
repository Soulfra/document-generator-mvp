# Onboarding Flow Example: Context Profiles & Premium Features

This document provides an example onboarding flow for new users, introducing context profiles, premium features, and upgrade opportunities.

---

## 1. Welcome & Context Profile Setup
- Greet the user and explain the value of context profiles (e.g., "Personalize your experience for Python, TypeScript, or React!")
- Prompt user to create or select a context profile
- Show a brief tour of profile options and benefits

## 2. Feature Discovery
- Highlight key features unlocked by context profiles (e.g., batch processing, advanced templates)
- Use tooltips or banners to indicate which features are premium

## 3. First Premium Action
- When the user attempts a premium feature, show a paywall modal with:
  - Profile-relevant upgrade messaging ("Upgrade to unlock batch processing for your Python projects!")
  - Clear CTA to upgrade
  - Feature comparison (Free vs Premium)

## 4. Upgrade Flow
- User clicks "Upgrade" and is redirected to Stripe payment
- After payment, user is upgraded and premium features are unlocked
- Show a confirmation and a quick tour of new capabilities

## 5. Ongoing Upsell
- Use analytics to trigger targeted upgrade prompts based on profile usage
- Show "Did you know?" modals for features the user hasn't tried yet
