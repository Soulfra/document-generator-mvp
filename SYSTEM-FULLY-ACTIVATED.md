# 🚀 DOCUMENT GENERATOR SYSTEM FULLY ACTIVATED

## Layer 66 Complete: Reasoning Differential → Wallet/Mesh Activation → API Network Integration

### ✅ What Just Happened

We successfully broke the mirrors, routed everything through DocuSign, applied OSS overlays, deployed agents, and activated the entire wallet/mesh network through differential reasoning!
