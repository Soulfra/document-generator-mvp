# 🏗️ COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE MAP & VERIFICATION GUIDE

## THE PROBLEM
"All this shit should be working but it's just not" - You have 80+ services across multiple layers but no clear way to verify what's actually operational vs what's just taking up space.

curl -s http://localhost:8800/
curl -s http://localhost:7090/
curl -s http://localhost:7300/
curl -s http://localhost:7100/

# Check gaming database tables
docker exec document-generator-postgres psql -U postgres -d document_generator \
  -c "SELECT * FROM game_sessions LIMIT 5;"
```

### **Layer 5: Real-time Tests**
```bash
# WebSocket connections
wscat -c ws://localhost:8081
wscat -c ws://localhost:7301
wscat -c ws://localhost:8091

# Check processes
ps aux | grep -E "(websocket|broadcast|event)" | grep -v grep
```

### **Layer 6: Monitoring Tests**
```bash
# System Monitor API
curl -s http://localhost:9200/health
curl -s http://localhost:9200/api/status | jq '.services[] | {name, status}'

# Check Prometheus/Grafana
curl -s http://localhost:9090/-/healthy
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/health
```

### **Layer 7: Integration Tests**
```bash
# Check environment variables
env | grep -E "(STRIPE|SENDGRID|DISCORD|TELEGRAM|ANTHROPIC|OPENAI)"

# Test webhook endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:3000/webhooks/stripe
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### **1. Gaming Layer is Shiprekt**
- All gaming services return 404 on health endpoints
- Services might be running but can't verify functionality
- Need to add proper health endpoints or find correct URLs

### **2. Monitoring Blindspots**
- Services appear "down" when they're actually running
- IPv6 vs IPv4 connectivity issues
- Wrong health endpoint paths

### **3. Unknown Service States**
- Many services in "unknown" state
- No standardized health checking
- Can't verify end-to-end workflows

---

## 🛠️ FIX PRIORITY ORDER

### **Priority 1: Fix Gaming Layer (2-4 hours)**
1. Add `/health` endpoints to all gaming services
2. Verify token economy functionality
3. Test game session persistence
4. Fix WebSocket connections

### **Priority 2: Standardize Health Checks (1-2 hours)**
1. Add `/health` to all services
2. Standardize response format: `{status: "healthy", service: "name"}`
3. Fix IPv6/IPv4 binding issues

### **Priority 3: Verify Integrations (2-3 hours)**
1. Test Discord/Telegram bots
2. Verify Stripe payment flow
3. Test email sending
4. Check webhook processing

### **Priority 4: End-to-End Testing (3-4 hours)**
1. Document upload → AI processing → MVP generation
2. Agent creation → Communication → Trading
3. Payment → Job processing → Notification

- `player_profiles` - User gaming data
- `token_transactions` - Economy history
- `gacha_pulls` - RNG results
- `empire_systems` - Empire building data
- `leaderboards` - Competitive rankings

## 🔄 BACKTEST EVERYTHING

Run the comprehensive backtest to verify all layers:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x comprehensive-backtest-framework.js

# Run full system backtest
./comprehensive-backtest-framework.js

# View results
cat backtest-report-*.json | jq '.summary'

# Check blindspots
cat backtest-report-*.json | jq '.blindspots'

# Get recommendations
cat backtest-report-*.json | jq '.recommendations'
```

## 📊 EXPECTED vs ACTUAL

### **What You Built** (Expected)
- Complete Document → MVP pipeline
- AI agent economy with trading
- Gaming platform with multiple games
- Full monitoring and alerting
- External integrations
- Deployment automation

### **What's Actually Working** (Verified)
- ✅ Database infrastructure
- ✅ AI inference (Ollama)
- ✅ Core document services
- ✅ Basic monitoring
- ⚠️ Auth/Security (partially)
- ❌ Gaming layer (broken)
- ❓ Everything else (unknown)

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Run the backtest framework** to get a complete picture
2. **Fix the gaming layer** - it's the most broken
3. **Standardize health endpoints** across all services
4. **Test end-to-end workflows** to verify actual functionality
5. **Document what actually works** vs what's just scaffolding

The good news: Your foundation is solid. The bad news: Lots of services need verification and fixing, especially the gaming layer.
