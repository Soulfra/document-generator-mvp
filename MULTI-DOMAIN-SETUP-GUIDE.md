# 🌐 Multi-Domain Game Empire Setup Guide

Your complete domain registry and zone configuration system is now ready! Here's how to get your **multi-domain game empire** up and running.

## 🎯 What You Now Have

✅ **DOMAIN-REGISTRY.json** - Configuration for your real domains  
✅ **domain-zone-mapper.js** - Generates zone-specific configs  
✅ **deploy-multi-domain.sh** - Automated deployment system  
✅ **Zone-based architecture** - Each domain = different game zone  
✅ **Cross-domain portals** - IRC/ARPANET-style navigation  
✅ **Unified branding system** - Domain-specific themes and assets  

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Configure Your Real Domains
Edit `DOMAIN-REGISTRY.json` and replace the placeholder domains:

```json
"YOUR-MAIN-DOMAIN.com": {
  "zone": {
    "type": "boss-room",
    "name": "Command Center"
  }
}
```

Replace with your actual domains like:
- `yourcompany.com` (main business site)
- `trading.yourcompany.com` (agent economy)  
- `lab.yourcompany.com` (collaborative zone)

### 2. Set Up Local Testing
Add to your `/etc/hosts` file:
```
127.0.0.1 your-main-domain.local
127.0.0.1 your-second-domain.local
127.0.0.1 your-third-domain.local
```

### 3. Launch the System
```bash
# Generate zone configs and start servers
./deploy-multi-domain.sh

# Or start manually
./start-multi-domain.sh
```

### 4. Test Your Zones
- Visit `http://your-main-domain.local:8080` → Boss Room Zone
- Visit `http://your-second-domain.local:8080` → Trading Floor Zone  
- Visit `http://your-third-domain.local:8080` → Collaborative Lab Zone

Each domain shows **different branding, functionality, and game mechanics**!
