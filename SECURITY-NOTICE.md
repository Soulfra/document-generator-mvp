# üö® IMMEDIATE SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

## Your API Keys Were Exposed

I found **real API keys** in your `.env` file:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: `sk-proj-5xCNq1564UimkG6...`
2. **Anthropic API Key**: `sk-ant-api03-QgxLZVP76ODLm...`  
3. **DeepSeek API Key**: `sk-251cc3d0befc44e...`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT TODO - DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Rotate Your API Keys IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] **OpenAI**: Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and regenerate your key
- [ ] **Anthropic**: Go to https://console.anthropic.com/ and regenerate your key  
- [ ] **DeepSeek**: Go to https://platform.deepseek.com/ and regenerate your key

### 2. Set Spending Limits
- [ ] OpenAI: Set monthly spending limit ($5-20 recommended for testing)
- [ ] Anthropic: Set usage limits in console
- [ ] DeepSeek: Monitor usage (typically very cheap)

### 3. Update Your Local Environment
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Fill in your NEW API keys
- [ ] Delete `.env.backup` when done

## ‚úÖ Good News

- Your `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files
- No real keys were committed to Git
- The exposed keys were only in your local file

## Next Steps

1. **Secure your keys** (above)
2. **Make this your blog** (I'll help with deployment)
3. **Set up production environment**

**Time sensitive**: Do the API key rotation first before continuing!
