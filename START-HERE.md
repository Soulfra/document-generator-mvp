## The Problem
Testing and implementation has been difficult. Here's the simplest path forward.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
If this fails, try:
```bash
npm install express ws multer node-fetch
```

## Step 2: Run ONE of These

### Option A: Character System (No Dependencies)
```bash
node character-system-max.js
```
This should work even without express installed.

### Option B: Test What Works
```bash
node test-it-now.js
```
This will test loading and show what's working.

### Option C: Fix and Run Everything
```bash
node fix-and-run.js
```
This installs dependencies and starts servers.

## What You Should See

If it works, you'll see characters introducing themselves:
```
ðŸŽ­ INITIALIZING CHARACTER SYSTEM MAX
ðŸŽµ Aria: Ready to orchestrate your vision into reality
ðŸŒŸ Nova: I'll explain everything in simple terms
```

## If Nothing Works

1. Check Node.js: `node --version` (need v16+)
2. Check files exist: `ls *.js`
3. Try the simplest file: `node character-system-max.js`

## What This Does

- Takes documents (PDF, markdown, chat logs)
- 7 AI characters analyze them
- Generates working code/MVP
- You approve key decisions
- Outputs deployable app

## The Key Files

1. `character-system-max.js` - The character AI system
2. `execute-character-system.js` - Web interface wrapper
3. `tier-connector.js` - Shows all 13+ system layers
4. `test-it-now.js` - Tests everything

Just pick one command and run it. Stop planning, start executing.
