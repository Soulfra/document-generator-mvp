# **Creative-Developer AI Bridge Platform**
## **The Universal Creative-Technical Translator**

### **üé® The Vision**
A platform where **creatives and developers collaborate through AI** - designers post visual concepts, developers get custom-tailored code, and AI bridges the gap between imagination and implementation.

        experience_level=requirements.complexity,
        budget_range=requirements.creative_budget
    )
    
    # Find compatible developers

        tech_stack=requirements.technology,
        project_type=requirements.application_type,
        budget_range=requirements.development_budget
    )
    
    # Score compatibility between creative + developer pairs
    team_compatibility = await score_collaboration_potential(
        creative_matches, 
        developer_matches,
        project_requirements=requirements
