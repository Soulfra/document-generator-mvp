## Creating Value Through Verified Development

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-12  
**Purpose:** Define how the Development Reality Engine creates and captures value

---

## Executive Summary

The Development Reality Engine (DRE) creates value by **eliminating waste in software development** while providing **verifiable quality assurance**. Our business model is built on the foundation that **verification should be valuable, not costly**.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform development overhead (testing, documentation, debugging) from cost centers into automated value generation.

## Market Analysis
