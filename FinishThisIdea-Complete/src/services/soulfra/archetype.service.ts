Oh! I see something interesting in your question about "${question}"...

*tilts head curiously*

You know what I notice? This feels like when you're trying to build something with blocks, but you can't see the picture on the box. The pattern is there, but it's hiding!

Let me ask you something: What if we looked at this upside down? Sometimes when I hold my drawing up to the mirror, I see mistakes I couldn't see before.

The simple truth is: ${this.extractSimplePattern(question)}

*eyes light up with recognition*

But here's the really magical part - this connects to something bigger! It's like... have you ever noticed how all snowflakes are different but they all have six points? Your question has that same kind of hidden symmetry.

What pattern do YOU see when you look at it this way? 🌟`;

*Thunder rolls in the distance*

YES! This question - "${question}" - it PULSES with potential! Can you feel it? The electricity in the air before lightning strikes?

This isn't just a problem to solve - this is a CATALYST for transformation! 

*Voice building with passionate energy*

Listen to me: Every great breakthrough came from someone who refused to accept "that's just how it's done." Someone who looked at the storm and didn't run for shelter - they DANCED in the rain!

Here's what the lightning shows me: ${this.extractTransformativeCore(question)}

*Eyes blazing with conviction*

But we're not stopping there! Oh no, we're going to SHATTER the conventional approach and forge something revolutionary! This solution won't just work - it will SING with elegance and power!

The storm is telling us: BUILD SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE INEVITABLE!

Are you ready to conduct this lightning? ⚡🎼`;

  private generateVoidWalkerResponse(question: string): string {
    return `🌫️ **Void Walker speaks from the spaces between...**

*Emerges from the liminal shadows*

Interesting... your question about "${question}" exists in the space between the asked and the unasked.

*Pauses thoughtfully*

You see, most seek answers where light shines brightest. But the void teaches us that the most profound solutions emerge from the darkness between certainties.

What you haven't asked: ${this.extractHiddenDimension(question)}

*Gestures to the emptiness that somehow contains everything*

The path you seek doesn't exist yet. It must be walked into being. This is not about finding the solution - it's about becoming the bridge between problem and possibility.

Consider: What if the answer exists in the space where your question meets its own negation?

*Voice becomes distant, otherworldly*

In the void between 'how' and 'why', between 'what is' and 'what could be', there lies a doorway. 

Step through. The unknown is not empty - it is pregnant with potential.

What will you discover in the space between your assumptions? 🌌`;

  private generateWeaverResponse(question: string): string {

*Hands move gracefully, as if working invisible threads*

Ah, your question about "${question}" - I can see the threads it connects to, the patterns it wants to join.

*Examines the weave with careful attention*

Let me show you what I see... Here, this thread connects to user experience. There, that one leads to system architecture. And this beautiful golden thread? That's the bridge between what users need and what technology can provide.

The pattern emerging is: ${this.extractIntegrativePattern(question)}

*Continues weaving*

But look closer - see how this connects to principles from completely different domains? The way water flows through a riverbed teaches us about data flow. The way musicians harmonize teaches us about API design. The way ecosystems balance teaches us about scalable architecture.

*Steps back to admire the growing tapestry*

Your solution isn't just a single thread - it's a beautiful integration where every element supports and enhances every other element. When we weave it correctly, the whole becomes greater than its parts.

What other threads do you see that want to be woven into this pattern? 🎨✨`;
  }

  private generateGuardianResponse(question: string): string {
    return `🛡️ **Guardian speaks with the voice of experience...**

*Stands with quiet authority*

Your question about "${question}" touches upon matters I have seen many approach, and I have witnessed both triumphs and failures.

*Eyes reflect deep knowledge*

First, let me share what I have learned through watching systems rise and fall: The most elegant solution means nothing if it cannot withstand the test of time and the pressure of real-world use.

The foundation you need: ${this.extractStableCore(question)}

*Voice carries the weight of accumulated wisdom*

But heed this warning - I have seen brilliant architects build beautiful castles on sand. Before you build, ask these questions that experience has taught me:

• How will this behave when scaled beyond your expectations?
• What happens when the unexpected user does the unexpected thing?
• Can this solution protect what is valuable while remaining accessible?
• Will future maintainers bless or curse your choices?

*Leans forward with paternal concern*

Build not just for today's requirements, but for tomorrow's challenges. The code you write today may outlive us both - ensure it serves those who come after.

True mastery lies not in clever solutions, but in solutions so solid and clear that they become the foundation for others to build upon.

What safeguards will you put in place? 🏰`;
