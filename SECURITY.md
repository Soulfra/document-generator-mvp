# Security Policy

## Overview

Document Generator takes security seriously. This document outlines security practices, vulnerability reporting, and best practices for secure deployment.

## üîê Security Features

### Vault System
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted keys stored in `.vault` directory
- **Access Control**: Master key required for decryption

### API Key Management
- **Never Hardcoded**: All API keys stored in environment variables
- **Vault Storage**: Sensitive keys encrypted using vault manager
- **Rotation Support**: Easy key rotation without code changes
- **Audit Trail**: Key access logging available

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with expiry
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin policies

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Never commit .env files
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   
   # Use .env.example for templates
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Vault Usage**
   ```bash
   # Initialize vault on first setup
   node vault-manager.js init
   
   # Store sensitive keys
   node vault-manager.js store-key stripe_key "sk_live_..."
   
   # Encrypt environment file
   node vault-manager.js encrypt-env
   ```

3. **Code Security**
   - Always validate user input
   - Use parameterized queries for databases
   - Sanitize output to prevent XSS
   - Keep dependencies updated

### For Deployment

1. **Production Configuration**
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   REQUIRE_HTTPS=true
   ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGS=false
   ENABLE_API_KEY_AUTH=true
   ```

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all external communication
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Use VPN for database connections
   - Enable SSL/TLS for Redis and databases

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Use strong passwords for all services
   - Enable 2FA where available
   - Regular security audits

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: security@documentgenerator.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

## üîç Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All API keys in environment variables
- [ ] Vault initialized and keys encrypted
- [ ] Production environment variables set
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest versions
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting active
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled
- [ ] Access logs configured
- [ ] Security patches automated
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## üîí Sensitive Data Handling

### What We Encrypt
- API keys and tokens
- Database credentials
- Payment processor keys
- OAuth secrets
- Encryption keys
- User passwords (hashed)

### What We Don't Store
- Credit card numbers (handled by Stripe)
- Unencrypted passwords
- Personal identification documents
- Unnecessary user data

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging
```javascript
// Security events logged
- Authentication attempts
- API key usage
- Permission changes
- Configuration updates
- Suspicious activities
```

### Alerts
Configure alerts for:
- Failed authentication spikes
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Configuration file changes
- Vault access attempts
- Service health issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### Recommended Security Scanners
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Docker image scanning
docker scan document-generator:latest

# Code security analysis
npx snyk test
```

### Security Headers
```nginx
# Recommended Nginx security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

## üöÄ Security Updates

### Update Process
1. Security patches released as soon as available
2. Subscribe to security notifications
3. Test updates in staging first
4. Deploy with zero downtime

### Version Support
- **Current Version**: Full support
- **Previous Version**: Security updates only
- **Older Versions**: Upgrade recommended
