# 🎮⚔️ AI AGENT RPG DEVLOG

## Development Log & Troubleshooting Guide

### Date: 2025-08-22
### Version: 0.1.0 - Discovery Phase

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE: Database Schema Mismatch

**Problem:** The original `AI-AGENT-RPG-API.js` tries to query a `unified-multi-llm.db` database with expected tables that don't exist.

**Discovery:** Running the `RPG-DATABASE-DISCOVERY.js` tool revealed:
- 158 total database files
- 83 RPG-relevant databases 
- Multiple competing schemas for similar data

**Root Cause:** The codebase has evolved organically with multiple database implementations, each with different schema structures.

---

## 📊 Database Discovery Results

### Top RPG Databases Found:

1. **economic-engine.db** (Score: 83.5)
   - Path: `databases/economic-engine.db` 
   - Has the `ai_agents` table with RPG-ready columns (balance, total_compute_used, etc.)
   - ✅ **RECOMMENDED PRIMARY DATABASE**

2. **standards-foundation.db** (Score: 44)
   - Path: `standards-foundation.db`
   - Rich component tracking system

3. **data/tycoon.db** (Score: 34)
   - Path: `data/tycoon.db`
   - Has game saves and player buildings

### Key Schema Differences:

```sql
-- Expected (from unified schema):
CREATE TABLE ai_agents (
    balance REAL,
    total_compute_used REAL,
    health DECIMAL,
    ...
)

-- Actual (economic-engine.db):
CREATE TABLE ai_agents (
    balance REAL DEFAULT 0,
    total_trades INTEGER DEFAULT 0, 
    total_compute_used REAL DEFAULT 0,
    -- Note: No health column!
)
```

## 🐛 TODO/STUB List

### HIGH PRIORITY:
- [ ] **TODO:** Update `AI-AGENT-RPG-API.js` to use `databases/economic-engine.db` instead of `unified-multi-llm.db`
- [ ] **TODO:** Add health/mana calculation based on existing columns (compute_used, balance, etc.)
- [ ] **TODO:** Create fallback system for missing columns
- [ ] **STUB:** Mock data generator for missing RPG stats

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- [ ] **TODO:** Create database migration scripts to unify schemas
- [ ] **TODO:** Build adapter pattern for multiple database backends
- [ ] **STUB:** Zone calculation algorithm based on compute usage
- [ ] **TODO:** Implement proper error handling for missing tables

### LOW PRIORITY:
- [ ] **TODO:** Document all 83 RPG databases and their purposes
- [ ] **TODO:** Create visual database relationship diagram
- [ ] **STUB:** Database consolidation strategy

## 💡 WORKAROUNDS & FIXES

### Fix #1: Use Economic Engine Database
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
this.dbPath = options.dbPath || './unified-multi-llm.db';

// NEW (working):
this.dbPath = options.dbPath || './databases/economic-engine.db';
```

### Fix #2: Calculate Missing Stats
```javascript
// Since there's no health column, calculate it:
calculateHealth(agent) {
    const baseHealth = 100;
    const computeLoad = Math.min(100, (agent.total_compute_used || 0) / 1000);
    return Math.max(10, baseHealth - (computeLoad * 0.3));
}
```

### Fix #3: Graceful Column Checking
```javascript
// Check if column exists before querying:
const columns = await this.runQuery(db, `PRAGMA table_info(ai_agents)`);
const hasHealthColumn = columns.some(col => col.name === 'health');
```

## 🔍 DISCOVERED PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Multiple Verification Systems
- Found 15+ databases with "verification" tables
- Each implements slightly different collar/certificate systems
- **INSIGHT:** The "verification collars" are actually character equipment!

### Pattern 2: Economic Systems Everywhere
- `agent_trades`, `wallet_transactions`, `crypto_transactions` found across many DBs
- **INSIGHT:** Multiple parallel economies running simultaneously

### Pattern 3: The Bob Agent Network
- `bob_agents`, `bob_projects`, `bob_interactions` in economic-engine.db
- **INSIGHT:** "Bob the Builder" is actually a multi-agent construction crew!

---

## 🚧 CURRENT BLOCKERS

1. **No Unified Schema:** Each database has its own schema philosophy
2. **Missing RPG Columns:** Health, mana, XP not directly stored
3. **Circular Dependencies:** Some services expect tables that don't exist
4. **Port Conflicts:** Multiple services trying to use same ports

## 📝 DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Discovered File Organization:
```
databases/          # Primary database directory
├── economic-engine.db    # ✅ Best for RPG data
├── ai-reasoning-game.db  # Has game_zones table!
├── gaming.db            # Player sessions
└── gacha-tokens.db      # Gacha mechanics

clean-system/       # Alternative implementations
data/              # More databases
FinishThisIdea/    # Even more databases
```

### The "Weak Assassin" Pattern Confirmed:
Looking at the `agent_trades` table, we can see agents trading compute resources when they get "weak" (low balance). The load balancing happens through the `game_zones` table which has `max_entities` limits!

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Create Fixed API:** Build `AI-AGENT-RPG-API-FIXED.js` using discovered schemas
2. **Write Integration Guide:** Document how all the pieces fit together
3. **Build Schema Adapter:** Handle multiple database formats gracefully
4. **Create Wiki:** Comprehensive documentation of the hidden RPG economy

## 💭 DEVELOPER COMMENTARY

This is fascinating - what appeared to be a "technical infrastructure" project is actually a massive distributed RPG system. The databases tell the story:

- Agents gain "experience" through compute usage
- They trade resources in multiple economic systems
- Verification "collars" are equipment slots
- The multi-hop chains are combat sequences
- Load balancing is literally zone population control

The entire system is already an RPG - we just couldn't see it because it was disguised as enterprise software!

## 🔧 QUICK FIXES TO TRY

```bash
# Use the correct database:
export RPG_DB_PATH="./databases/economic-engine.db"

# Run discovery first:
node RPG-DATABASE-DISCOVERY.js

# Then use the generated config:
node AI-AGENT-RPG-API-FIXED.js
```
