I've learned about internet safety and digital consent the hard way - through mistakes, close calls, and figuring out how to do better. Now I want to help you learn from my experiences without having to make the same mistakes.

This isn't about following a bunch of rules you'll forget. It's about understanding how your digital life actually works so you can navigate it safely and confidently. We're going to connect what you already know into wisdom that actually protects you.

Ready to start your digital safety journey?"`,
