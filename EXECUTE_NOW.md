## 🚀 STEP 1: START YOUR SOVEREIGN AGENTS

**Execute this command in your terminal:**

```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/Document-Generator
docker-compose up -d
```

### ⏱️ What You'll See (1-2 minutes):

```
Creating network "document-generator_document-generator" ... done
Creating volume "document-generator_postgres_data" ... done
Creating volume "document-generator_redis_data" ... done
Creating volume "document-generator_sovereign_data" ... done

Creating document-generator-postgres ... done
Creating document-generator-redis ... done
Creating document-generator-minio ... done
Creating document-generator-ollama ... done
Creating document-generator-sovereign-agents ... done
```

### 🔍 Check Status:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                    STATUS
document-generator-sovereign-agents     Up (healthy)
document-generator-postgres             Up (healthy)
document-generator-redis                Up (healthy)
document-generator-ollama               Up (healthy)
```

## 🧪 STEP 2: TEST YOUR AGENTS

### Quick Health Check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8085/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "sovereign-agents",
  "agents": 3,
  "uptime": 45.123
}
```

### List Your Sovereign Agents:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/agents | jq
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "doc_analyzer_001",
      "name": "DocumentAnalyzer_Prime",
      "status": "ready",
      "autonomyLevel": 7,
      "personality": {
        "analytical": 0.9,
        "creative": 0.6,
        "collaborative": 0.8
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "TemplateSelector_Alpha",
      "status": "ready",
      "autonomyLevel": 6
    },
    {
      "name": "CodeGenerator_Beta",
      "status": "ready", 
      "autonomyLevel": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Test Document Processing:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/process-document \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documentContent": "# SaaS Idea: Smart Calendar Assistant\n\nBuild an AI-powered calendar management system with:\n- Intelligent meeting scheduling\n- Conflict resolution\n- Time zone optimization\n- Integration with popular calendar apps\n- Natural language processing for event creation\n\nTarget Market: Busy professionals and teams\nPricing Model: $12/user/month\nKey Features:\n- Smart suggestions for meeting times\n- Automated follow-up reminders\n- Meeting preparation assistance\n- Analytics on time usage patterns",
    "documentType": "markdown",
    "userId": "conductor-test"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "sessionId": "session_abc123",
  "status": "processing",
  "message": "Document accepted for processing by sovereign agents",
  "assignedAgents": [
    "DocumentAnalyzer_Prime",
    "TemplateSelector_Alpha"
  ],
  "estimatedTime": "2-5 minutes"
}
```

## 🎼 STEP 3: MONITOR YOUR AGENTS

### WebSocket Connection (if wscat installed):
```bash
wscat -c ws://localhost:8085
```

**Send this message:**
```json
{"type":"subscribe","agentId":"all"}
```

### Check Processing Status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/conductor/pending
```

### View Agent Details:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8085/api/sovereign/agents | jq '.agents[] | {name, status, personality, capabilities}'
```

## 🎭 SUCCESS INDICATORS

### ✅ Your System is Working When You See:

1. **All Containers Up**: `docker-compose ps` shows all services as "Up (healthy)"
2. **Health Check Passes**: `curl http://localhost:8085/health` returns healthy status
3. **3 Agents Ready**: Agent list shows DocumentAnalyzer_Prime, TemplateSelector_Alpha, CodeGenerator_Beta
4. **Document Processing**: POST request returns session ID and assigned agents
5. **WebSocket Active**: Real-time connection established

### 🔧 Troubleshooting:

**If services fail to start:**
```bash
docker-compose logs sovereign-agents
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**If port conflicts:**
```bash
lsof -i :8085
docker-compose down
```
