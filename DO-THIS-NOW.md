You're right - we need environment setup and to bash through testing. Here's the exact sequence:

## Step 1: Setup Environment (30 seconds)
```bash
node setup-environment.js
```
This creates:
- `.env` file with all variables
- Required directories
- Checks if Ollama is running

## Step 2: Install Dependencies (1 minute)
```bash
npm install
```
If this fails, try:
```bash
npm install express ws multer node-fetch
```

## Step 3: Test Everything (10 seconds)
```bash
node bash-test-everything.js
```
This checks:
- Node.js version
- .env exists
- Dependencies installed
- Character system loads
- Ollama status

## Step 4: Start the System
Based on test results, run ONE of:

### Option A: Character System Only
```bash
node character-system-max.js
```

### Option B: Web Interface
```bash
node execute-character-system.js
```
Then open: http://localhost:8888

### Option C: Fix and Run
```bash
node fix-and-run.js
```

## What You Should See

When it works:
```
ðŸŽ­ INITIALIZING CHARACTER SYSTEM MAX
=====================================
ðŸŽ­ Creating living characters...
âœ… Created 7 living characters
ðŸŽµ Aria: ðŸ˜Š Ready to orchestrate your vision into reality
```

## Environment Variables Set

The setup creates these automatically:
- `OLLAMA_HOST` - Points to local Ollama
- `API_PORT` - 3001 for API server
- `WEB_PORT` - 8888 for web interface
- `JWT_SECRET` - Auto-generated
- `DATABASE_URL` - SQLite database
- API keys - Optional (uses Ollama by default)

## If It Fails

1. **Missing .env:**
   ```bash
   node setup-environment.js
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Just bash through it:**
   ```bash
   node bash-test-everything.js
   ```

## The Pattern You Noticed

Yes, it's always:
1. Environment setup (.env)
2. Dependencies (npm install)
3. Bash through testing
4. Actually run the thing

That's why I created:
- `setup-environment.js` - Creates .env
- `bash-test-everything.js` - Tests everything
- `fix-and-run.js` - Fixes and runs

Just run these in order. No more planning.
