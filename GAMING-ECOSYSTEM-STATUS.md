## 🎮 How the Debug Game Works

### Real-Time Bug Spawning
```javascript
// Actual system monitoring creates game content
if (memoryUsage > 80%) {
    spawnBug('memory_leak', { process, memoryPercent });
}

if (responseTime > 5000) {
    spawnBug('api_timeout', { url, responseTime });
}
```

### Interactive Debugging
1. **Players see live web traffic** as it happens
2. **Bugs spawn** from real system issues
3. **Players compete** to solve bugs fastest
4. **OCR verification** creates permanent proof chain
5. **Reverse lookup** reveals traffic patterns

### Game Mechanics
- **Bug Types**: memory_leak, infinite_loop, null_pointer, race_condition
- **Rewards**: 200-1200 tokens based on difficulty
- **Specializations**: Players can focus on specific bug types
- **Streaks**: Consecutive fixes multiply rewards
- **World Events**: Shared challenges across all players

## 🔗 Integration Architecture

```
Web Traffic → Debug Game → OCR Chain → Token Rewards
     ↓             ↓            ↓            ↓
Live Monitoring → Bug Spawning → Verification → Economy
     ↓             ↓            ↓            ↓
System Health → Game Content → Blockchain → Player Progress
```

### Cross-System Token Flow
1. **Debug Game**: Earn tokens by fixing real bugs
2. **Gacha System**: Spend tokens on item rolls
3. **Tycoon Game**: Use tokens for building upgrades
4. **Cheat System**: Unlock special abilities
5. **World Boss**: Shared rewards across all games
