## Stop Playing War Games

Instead of coordinating 47 different services and databases:

1. **Pick ONE idea from above**
2. **Build it in 2 weeks max**
3. **Deploy it and get real users**
4. **Make actual money**
5. **Then add the next feature**

## The Real Question

**What do YOU actually want to build right now?**

Not the grand empire. Not the perfect architecture. What's the ONE thing you want working by next Friday?

Because all this microservices/branches/worktree stuff is just procrastination dressed up as engineering.

Let's pick one thing and actually build it.
