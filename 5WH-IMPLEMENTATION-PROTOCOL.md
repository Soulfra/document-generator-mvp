- [ ] Understand gaming and RNG systems in codebase
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing systems

### 2. Environment Setup

- [ ] Development tools installed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: WHERE - Spatial Locator Implementation

#### 1.1 Core Positioning System
```javascript
// Core data structures
Position: { x: number, y: number, z?: number }
Velocity: { dx: number, dy: number, dz?: number }
Region: { bounds: BoundingBox, type: string }
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `packages/@utp/spatial-locator/` directory
2. Initialize package.json with dependencies
3. Implement core positioning classes:
   - `SpatialLocator` - Main class
   - `Position` - 3D coordinate system
   - `Movement` - Velocity and direction tracking
   - `Region` - Area definitions and boundaries
4. Add spatial relationship calculations:
   - Distance between points
   - Proximity detection
   - Collision detection
   - Path finding (A* algorithm)

#### 1.2 Gaming Integration
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create game-specific adapters:
   - MMORPG position tracking
   - Screen coordinate mapping

   - "Check line of sight"

#### 1.3 Expression Parsing
**Format:** `where:location-expression`
```
Examples:
where:spawn-point
where:x100-y200

   - Branch conditions
   - Probability weights
2. Add tree evaluation:
   - Path calculation
   - Expected value computation
   - Monte Carlo simulation
3. Create visualization:
   - Tree structure export

   - Probability overlay

#### 2.3 Expression Parsing
**Format:** `why:reasoning-expression`
```
Examples:
why:rng(0.85)

why:decision(attack>defense)
why:theory(bayes-theorem)
```

### Phase 3: HOW - Logic Orchestrator Implementation

#### 3.1 Workflow Engine
```javascript
// Workflow components
Workflow: { steps: Step[], transitions: Transition[] }
Step: { id: string, action: Action, conditions: Condition[] }
Transition: { from: string, to: string, trigger: Trigger }
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `packages/@utp/logic-orchestrator/` directory
2. Implement workflow engine:
   - State machine implementation
   - Step execution engine
   - Condition evaluator
3. Add orchestration patterns:
   - Sequential execution
   - Parallel processing
   - Conditional branching
   - Loop constructs
4. Create workflow persistence:
   - Save/load workflows
   - Execution history
   - Rollback capability

#### 3.2 Integration Hub
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create unified event bus:
   - Subscribe to all 5W+H events
   - Route events to workflows
   - Maintain event history
2. Implement action dispatcher:
   - Map actions to handlers
   - Execute with context
   - Handle failures gracefully
3. Add monitoring:
   - Workflow execution metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - Error reporting

#### 3.3 Expression Parsing
**Format:** `how:method-expression`
```

how:automated
how:state-machine(combat-flow)
how:event-driven
how:manual-review
how:parallel(tasks:5)
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

#### 4.1 Component Integration
**Steps:**
1. Create unified 5W+H processor:
   ```javascript
   class UnifiedProcessor {
     processInput(text: string): Evidence
     aggregateEvidence(components: Evidence[]): UnifiedContext
     executeAction(context: UnifiedContext): Result
   }
   ```
2. Implement evidence aggregation:
   - Collect from all components
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Build complete context
3. Add routing logic:

## Rollback Plan

If implementation issues arise:
1. Components are independently deployable
2. Feature flags control activation
3. Previous versions remain compatible
4. Data migration is reversible

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered successful when:
1. All 6 components (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW) are functional
2. Integration tests pass with >95% coverage
3. Performance meets defined SLAs
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. Demo applications showcase full capabilities

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (WHERE): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (WHY): 2-3 days  
- Phase 3 (HOW): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Integration): 2 days
- Phase 5 (Documentation): 1 day

Total: 9-12 days for complete implementation

## Next Steps
