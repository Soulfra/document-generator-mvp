# ðŸ“¦ Isometric World Editor

## What's Different Now?

This is a **proper world editor** with actual controls and functionality - like Habbo Hotel but for documents.

## Key Features That Actually Work

### ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls**
- **Click to place** - Objects snap to isometric grid
- **Drag to pan** - Move around your world
- **Scroll to zoom** - Get closer or see overview
- **Keyboard controls** - WASD movement, R to rotate, Delete to remove

### ðŸ“¦ **Object System**
- **6 object types**: Block, Tree, Building, Water, Road, Document
- **Grid-based placement** - Objects align properly
- **Properties panel** - Adjust rotation, height, color
- **Document conversion** - Drop files to create object patterns

### ðŸ’¾ **Working Exports**
- **Save/Load World** - JSON format with all object data
- **Export PNG** - Screenshot of current view
- **Export ASCII** - Terminal-friendly world map
- **GIF Recording** - Capture animation frames

## How to Use
