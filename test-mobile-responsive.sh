echo "🧪 TESTING RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:"
echo "=============================="
echo ""

echo "1️⃣ DESKTOP TEST:"
echo "   Open: http://localhost:8888"
echo "   Expected: Three-panel layout (Rigid-Fluid-Minimap)"
echo ""

echo "2️⃣ MOBILE TEST:"
echo "   Open: http://localhost:8888 on mobile device"
echo "   Expected: Tab-based interface with touch gestures"
echo ""

echo "3️⃣ RESPONSIVE SONAR:"
echo "   The sonar system now adapts to:"
echo "   • Mobile: Touch-optimized, compact display"
echo "   • Tablet: Medium-density interface"
echo "   • Desktop: Full-resolution display"
echo ""

echo "4️⃣ PWA FEATURES:"
echo "   • Installable as mobile app"
echo "   • Works offline with service worker"
echo "   • Touch gestures: swipe, tap, long-press"
echo "   • Responsive breakpoints"
echo ""

echo "🔍 DEVICE DETECTION:"
echo "==================="
echo "The system automatically detects:"
echo "• Screen size and orientation"
echo "• Touch vs mouse input"
echo "• Mobile/tablet/desktop type"
echo "• Network connectivity"
echo ""

echo "📋 MOBILE GESTURES:"
echo "=================="
echo "• ← → Swipe: Navigate tabs"
echo "• ↑ Swipe: Refresh content" 
echo "• 👆 Tap: Interact with elements"
echo "• ⏱️ Long press: Context menu"
echo ""

echo "🌊 THREE-LAYER ADAPTATION:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""

echo "📱 MOBILE:"
echo "   • Rigid APIs: Tab 1 (Touch-optimized buttons)"
echo "   • Fluid State: Tab 2 (Compact event stream)"
echo "   • Minimap: Tab 3 (Small viewport MUD)"
echo "   • Sonar: Tab 4 (Responsive radar)"
echo ""

echo "🖥️ DESKTOP:"
echo "   • Rigid APIs: Left panel (Full endpoint list)"
echo "   • Fluid State: Center panel (Large blockchain viz)"
echo "   • Minimap: Right panel (Full sonar + MUD terminal)"
echo ""

echo "🔗 UNIVERSAL STATE:"
echo "=================="
echo "All devices connect to the same:"
echo "• WebSocket server (port 8889)"
echo "• Existing Fluid State Manager"
echo "• Rigid API endpoints"
echo "• Blockchain-like event chain"
echo ""

echo "✅ ADDRESSES USER CONCERN:"
echo "========================="
echo "\"we've been building this for what feels like a desktop app\""
echo "\"but its most likely going to be mobile and need to be resizable\""
echo "\"because there are so many different types of phones\""
echo ""
echo "✅ SOLUTION:"
echo "   • Universal kernel abstracts device differences"
echo "   • Mobile-first responsive design"
echo "   • Touch gesture support"
echo "   • Progressive Web App features"
echo "   • Same three-layer architecture on all devices"

echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop the test"

# Show real-time connections
echo "🔌 REAL-TIME MONITORING:"
echo "========================"
echo "Watch the console output above to see:"
echo "• Device connections and types"
echo "• WebSocket events"
echo "• Touch gesture recognition"
echo "• Viewport changes"
